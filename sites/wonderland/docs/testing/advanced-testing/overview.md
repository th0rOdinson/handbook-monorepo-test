# Overview

This part of the guide covers our best practices for more advanced testing techniques, which are done at the end of the development cycle only (as they're more time and caffeine-consuming) and test the system as a whole.

We add more formalized testing suite following 2 different approaches:

- stateful property-based fuzzing using Medusa
- stateless symbolic execution using Halmos or Kontrol

To guide our testing, we use the properties written during the design phase, updated with any change which might have happened during the implementation.

Having these 2 extra-steps consolidates the testing framework built around our protocol: unit tests are studying how a given part is working, integration is ensuring how multiple parts are working together during defined cases, property-based fuzzing will now study how the whole protocol is working in a big number of cases with multiple interactions (stateful) and formal verification will study how the protocol is working in *every possible* case (usually statelessly).

# Properties & Invariants

During the design phase of a new project, we start collecting the protocol properties and invariants (either from the new design or pre-existing specification/requirements). At this stage of the development, this means having a bullet point list describing what and how the project will behave. It includes invariants, that are always true, or some more specific scenarios, called properties (the distinction being pedantic only, both terms are used interchangeably).

In short, think of how the protocol would be described as a whole, from a helicopter point of view. With the list of properties, someone should be able to create a system which will behave in the same way as the one tested, without knowing the implementation details. 

For a more detailed approach on our way of finding and writing invariants, check the [Invariants writing strategy](./invariants-writing.md).

These properties are the foundations of the last step in the tests implementation, as they are the invariants which will be challenged via formal verification or fuzzing campaign. It is therefore important to make sure they're well written from the start, with no stones left unturned.

📝 Exercise: try to find the properties/invariants of this system

```solidity
uint256 totalMinted;
mapping(address owner => uint256 balance) balanceOf;

function mint(uint256 amount) external {
	balanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;
	totalMinted += amount;
}

function burn(uint256 amount) external {
  if(balanceOf[msg.sender] < amount) revert("minBal");
	balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
}
```

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution</summary>
    - totalMinted is the sum of all the mint
    - an address cannot burn more than its current balance
    - an address balance is the sum of all its mints, minus its burns
    - totalMinted never decreases
</details>

Special cases: for math library or functions, properties can take the form of the underlying mathematical properties describing the operation (eg an addition is commutative, has a neutral element 0 over the real numbers, etc), as well as hedge cases (0, max, etc).

📝 Exercise: try to find the properties/invariants of this system

```solidity
function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) external returns(uint256) {
		unchecked {
			if( a*b / a != b) revert("OF");
		}
    return a * b;
}
```

<details>
<summary>✅ Solution</summary>
    - Unit: mul should be associative, so that `mul(mul(a, b), c)` is the same as `mul(a, mul(b, c))`
    - Unit: mul should be commutative
    - Unit: mul should be distributive
    - Unit: mul should have 1 as identity element
    - Unit: mul should have 0 as absorbing element (this is both a property and a hedge case)
    - Unit: should throw if a*b is greater than uint256 max
</details>

## General tricks

Many approaches to conduct a testing campaign can be taken and are “correct”, yet having a systematic and well-organized one helps *a lot*. Here are some take-aways from previous project, which *might* help:

- Start by reviewing the properties and invariants. See the doc above on how to find them, keeping in mind that **"having only a few selected critical (and well tested) invariants is therefore better than a list of 50 highly complex, tightly coupled to the implementation, ones"**.
- Setup for fuzzing or formal verification can be taken from the integration tests - rather as a template than blindly pasting them, as to avoid inheriting any complexity debt coming from setting up a fork for instance.
- We tend to start from one given path (ie "how to test the first invariant" for instance), including handlers to reach it, then incrementally add to cover other (instead of, for instance, adding handlers for every functions and deal with the complexity later).
- Test functions are easier to grasp when expressed in Hoare logic (precondition, including pranks - action, as a single call - postcondition). In the rare case where multiple actions are conducted within a single test function, this is expressed as multiple Hoare logic blocks.

```solidity
function testOne() public {
  // Pre-condition
  vm.warp(123);
  address caller = address(123);
  deal(caller, 1 ether);
  
  vm.prank(caller);
  
  // Action
  target.deposit{value: 1 ether}();
  
  // Post-condition
  assert(target.balance(caller), 1 ether);
}
```

- Assessing a test function has 3 steps, once the test passes:
    - Check the coverage to see if the test itself is not (silently) reverting and if the target code is actually covered
    - Make sure both sides of a revert are covered with try - assert - catch - assert.
    - Mutate the property itself or the target code. See [Mutation testing](../mutation-testing.md) for more details
    
    <aside>
    ⚠️
    
    Unlike what you could be used to in regular unit or integration tests, only assert with a condition equals to false will make a test revert - without the previous checks, it is therefore easy to take a passing test for granted, especially as most contracts are using require and revert (in other words, if one doesn’t pay attention, one can easily end up testing nothing). 
    
    ```solidity
    function testOne() public {
      require(false);
    }
    
    function testTwo public {
      assert(false);
    }
    ```
    
    </aside>
    
- Any state which can be accessed or reconstructed from the target should be (even if some needs to be recomputed, for instance reducing individual balances to a cumulative sum). If there is no way to do so, then a ghost variable should be used (either in the relevant handler, or, usually easier, in a “BaseHandler” contract, with relevant helper functions).
- Always start with validating the initial setup and sanity checks as “property-0”. For instance, address of the deployed contract ≠ 0, calling some constant variables, etc.

- Function names:
    - `setup_*` functions shouldn’t have assertion, they’re used to set some stuff up, in Medusa, with fuzzed args as constructor cannot have args, same for handlers.
    - `property_*` functions are targets in assert mode
    - `prove_*` is the default prefix for Kontrol, `check_*` is the equivalent for Halmos

## Reporting found issues

Sometimes when testing, you will find bugs and hopefully they won’t be Medusa and Kontrol bugs but actual errors in the project’s code. The first step in handling the issue should always be notifying the dev team and validating the finding. Then depending on the validity and fixability of the issue we have multiple choices.

### Invalid finding

If the finding could not be confirmed by the dev team, we should look for errors in the test and fix them.

### Valid finding

If the finding is confirmed, the first step is always gathering the details and filling in the report under the project’s internal testing page. During the process, you will assign the finding a unique ID.

If the issue can be fixed, we should convert the Medusa / Kontrol test into a simple unit or integration test, and specify the issue ID in the test’s natspec.

If the issue won’t be fixed, we still need a way to reproduce it. To simplify this process, we have settled on the following steps:

- If it doesn’t exist yet, create a `PropertiesFailing` contract and inherit it in `PropertiesParent`
- In the failing properties contract, add a test for the found issue. Make sure to specify the issue ID in the natspec.
- Append the test name to the `excludeFunctionSignatures` property of the Medusa config. Note that the signature should start with the fuzz contract name:
    
    ```
    "excludeFunctionSignatures": [
      "FuzzTest.property_givenDepositsIsGreaterThanZero_totalWeights_isNotZero()"
    ]
    ```
